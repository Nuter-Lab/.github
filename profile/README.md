## 🧠 Overview  

**Aimbot** is a user interface enhancement mod for **Fortnite** designed to improve clarity, accessibility, and visual feedback without changing core gameplay mechanics. Instead of altering game performance or player advantage, this mod focuses on presenting information in a cleaner, more readable layout so players can make decisions more comfortably during fast-paced matches.

The mod repositions key UI elements such as the health bar, inventory, map, and action prompts to reduce clutter and boost readability. It also introduces customizable layouts and larger font options for players who prefer clearer on-screen data during intense moments.

Aimbot aims to offer a more personalized Fortnite interface for creative play, stream overlays, and accessibility — especially for players who value a cleaner heads-up display and smoother visual organization.
